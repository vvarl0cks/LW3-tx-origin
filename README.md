# ðŸ§  tx.origin vs msg.sender
## Why not to use tx.origin to determine the sender of a transaction

# What is tx.origin?

tx.origin is a global variable which returns the address of the account which sent the transaction. Now you might be wondering then what is msg.sender ðŸ¤”. The difference is that tx.origin refers to the original external account (which is the user) that started the transaction and msg.sender is the immediate account that called the function and it can be an external account or another contract calling the function.

So for example, if User calls Contract A, which then calls contract B within the same transaction, msg.sender will be equal to Contract A when checked from inside Contract B. However, tx.origin will be the User regardless of where you check it from.

# ðŸ‘® Prevention

You should use msg.sender instead of tx.origin to not let this happen. There is almost never a good use case for tx.origin except in very specific cases - and in those times, be VERY careful.

Example:
```shell
function setOwner(address newOwner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not owner" );
    owner = newOwner;
}
```
